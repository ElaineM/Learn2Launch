						<p>How do you know if your idea has potential?  Valiate your idea(s) with feedback from potential users, estimating potential market size, and figuring out technical feasibility. Craft a product concept statement, validate it with at least 8 potential users (make sure they are not people you know), and perform feasibility tests by identifying 10 quick solutions.  This process will help you to crystalize your idea into a MVP that can be designed and prototyped in the next phase.</p>

						<h1 class="ideate_headlines">What I Wish Someone Had Told Me About Startups 4 Years Ago</h1>
						<p>The year is 2007, and I had just left Microsoft to dive into the startup world. Like many first time entrepreneurs, I was very excited about the adventure. And like many first time entrepreneurs, I didn’t know where to start.
						So I attended events, meetups, conferences, and mingled with the local startup community in Seattle. When time came to move to the Bay Area, I found even more events, more meetups, and more conferences. The startup ecosystem was so busy and alive, and I found a wealth of knowledge and experience being shared, which I consumed eagerly.</p>
